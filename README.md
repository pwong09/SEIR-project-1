☐ Minesweeper - a single player game to reveal the entire board without left-clicking on any bombs. Right-click to mark where a potential bomb is. Bombs' positions are indicated by the numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.) on the board that will show how many bombs are adjacent to that particular square. If a square is empty, then that means the square has no adjacent squares containing a bomb.
